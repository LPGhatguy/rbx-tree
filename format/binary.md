## Document Conventions
This document assumes a basic understanding of Rust's conventions for numeric types. For example:

- `u16` is an unsigned 16-bit integer
- `i32` is a signed 32-bit integer

Integers are assumed to be little endian and 2's complement unless otherwise specified. Big endian integers and integers with interesting transformations are present in this document and are explicitly noted.

## File Structure
1. File Header
2. Chunks
	1. Zero or one `META` chunks
	2. Zero or one `SSTR` chunks
	3. Zero or more `INST` chunk
	4. Zero or more `PROP` chunks
	5. One `PRNT` chunk
	6. One `END` chunk

## File Header
Every file starts with a 32 byte header.

| Field Name          | Format  | Value                                         |
|:--------------------|:--------|:----------------------------------------------|
| Magic Number        | 8 bytes | Always `<roblox!`                             |
| Signature           | 6 bytes | Always `89 ff 0a 1a 0a`                       |
| Version             | u16     | Always `0`                                    |
| Instance Type Count | i32     | Number of distinct instance types in the file |
| Instance Count      | i32     | Number of instances in the file               |
| Reserved            | 8 bytes | Always `0`                                    |

## Chunks
Every chunk starts with a 16 byte header followed by the chunk's data.

| Field Name          | Format  | Value                                             |
|:--------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Chunk Name          | 4 bytes | The chunk's name, like `META` or `INST`           |
| Compressed Length   | u32     | Length of the chunk in bytes, if it is compressed |
| Uncompressed Length | u32     | Length of the chunk's data after decompression    |
| Reserved            | 4 bytes | Always `0`                                        |

If **chunk name** is less than four bytes, the remainder is filled with zeros.

If **compressed length** is zero, **chunk data** contains **uncompressed length** bytes of data for the chunk.

If **compressed length** is nonzero, **chunk data** contains an LZ4 compressed block. It is **compressed length** bytes long and will expand to **uncompressed length** bytes when decompressed.

When the **chunk data** is compressed, it is done so using the [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) compression algorithm.

When documentation for individual chunks uses the term "chunk data", it refers to **chunk data** after it has been decompressed, if necessary.

### `META` Chunk
The `META` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name                 | Format         | Value                                       |
|:---------------------------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Number of Metadata Entries | u32            | The number of metadata entries in the chunk |
| Metadata Entries           | Array(Entries) | The actual metadata entries                 |

Each metadata entry has the following format:

| Field Name     | Format | Value                                    |
|:---------------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Metadata Key   | String | The metadata key, which should be unique |
| Metadata Value | String | The value for this metadata key          |

The Metadata chunk (`META`) is a map of strings to strings. It represents metadata about the model, such as whether it was authored with `ExplicitAutoJoints` enabled.

There should be zero or one `META` chunks.

Observed metadata entries and their values:

- `ExplicitAutoJoints`: `true` or `false`

### `SSTR` Chunk
The `SSTR` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name          | Format                | Value                                        |
|:--------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Version             | u32                   | The version of the `SSTR` chunk (always `0`) |
| Shared String Count | u32                   | The number of SharedStrings in the chunk     |
| Strings             | Array(Shared Strings) | The actual shared string entries             |

A shared string entry looks like this:

| Field Name    | Format   | Value                                                                   |
|:--------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MD5 Hash      | 16 bytes | An [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the `Shared String` |
| Shared String | String   | The string that's used by a later `PROP` chunk                          |

The Shared String chunk (`SSTR`) is an array of strings. It's used to reduce the overall size of a file by allowing large strings to be reused in [`PROP`](#prop-chunk) chunks. The `MD5 Hash` isn't used by Roblox Studio when loading the file.

There should be zero or one `SSTR` chunks.

### `INST` Chunk
The `INST` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name         | Format           | Value                                           |
|:-------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Type ID            | u32              | An arbitrarily-chosen ID to refer to this type  |
| Type Name          | String           | The type's name, like `Folder` or `Part`        |
| Object Format      | u8               | Always `0` (regular instance) or `1` (service)  |
| Number Instances   | u32              | The number of instances of this type            |
| Instance Referents | Array(Referent)  | The instance referents in the file of this type |
| Service Markers    | Array(u8)        | If **Object Format** is `1`, contains the byte `1` once for each instance in the chunk. Otherwise, not present. |

The Instance chunk (`INST`) defines a type of instance, how many of them there are in this file, and what referent IDs they have.

There should be one `INST` chunk for each type of instance defined.

There are two forms of the `INST` chunk determined by the **Object Format** field:

- `0`: regular
- `1`: service

If the **Object Format** is **regular**, the service markers section will not be present.

If the **Object Format** is **service**, the service markers section contains `1` repeated for the number of instances of that type in the file. If this field is not set, Roblox may create duplicate copies of services, like in [rojo-rbx/rbx-dom#11](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/11).

**Type ID** must be unique and ideally sorted monotonically among all `INST` chunks. It's used later in the file to refer to this type.

**Type Name** should match the `ClassName` specified on an instance in Roblox.

The length of the **Instance Referents** array must match the **Number of Instances** field.

### `PROP` Chunk
The `PROP` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name    | Format       | Value                                                      |
|:--------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Type ID       | u32          | The type ID assigned in the `INST` chunk                   |
| Property Name | String       | The name of the property, like `CFrame`                    |
| Data Type     | u8           | The [Data Type](#data-types) of this property              |
| Values        | Array(value) | A list of values whose type is determined by **Data Type** |

The property chunk (`PROP`) defines a single property for a single instance type.

There should be one `PROP` chunk per property per instance type.

Because of the shape of this chunk, every instance of a given type must have the same properties specified with the same times. Put another way, if any instance in the file defines a property, all other instances of the same type must also specify that property!

**Type ID** defines the instance that this property applies to as defined in a preceding `INST` chunk.

**Property Name** defines the serializable name of the property. Note that this is not necessarily the same as the name reflected to Lua, which is sometimes referred to as the _canonical name_.

**Data Type** corresponds to a value from [Data Types](#data-types).

**Values** contains an array of values of **Data Type** whose length is the same as the number of instances with the type ID **Type ID**.

### `PRNT` Chunk
The `PRNT` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name        | Format                       | Value                                     |
|:------------------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| Version           | u8                           | Always `0`                                |
| Number of Objects | u32                          | Number of objects described in this chunk |
| Objects           | Array([Referent](#referent)) | Objects to be parented                    |
| Parents           | Array(Referent)              | Parents for objects                       |

The parent chunk (`PRNT`) defines the hierarchy relationship between every instance in the file.

There should be exactly one `PRNT` chunk.

**Version** field should currently always be zero.

**Number of Objects** should be the same as the number of instances in the file header chunk, since each object should have a parent.

**Object Array** and **Parent Array** should both have length equal to **Number of Objects**. The parent of the ID at position *N* in the **Object Array** is a child of the ID at position *N* in the **Parent Array**.

A null parent referent (`-1`) indicates that the object is a root instance. In a place, that means the object is a child of `DataModel`. In a model, that means the object should be placed directly under the object the model is being inserted into.

### `END` Chunk
The `END` chunk has this layout:

| Field Name  | Format  | Value              |
|:------------|:--------|:-------------------|
| Magic Value | 9 bytes | Always `</roblox>` |

The ending chunk (`END`) signifies the end of the file.

The `END` chunk must not be compressed. It is used as a rough form of file validation when uploading places to the Roblox website.

## Data Types

### String
**Type ID `0x01`**

The `String` type is stored as a length-prefixed sequence of bytes. The length is stored as an untransformed 32-bit integer. Strings are UTF-8 encoded.

| Field Name | Format       | Value                                    |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Length     | `u32`        | The length of the string                 |
| Data       | Array(Bytes) | The actual bytes that make up the string |

When an array of strings is present, they are stored in sequence without any modification.

### Bool
**Type ID `0x02`**

The `Bool` type is stored as a single byte. If the byte is `0x00`, the bool is `false`. If it is `0x01`, it is `true`.

When an array of Bools is present, they are stored in sequence.

### Int32
**Type ID `0x03`**

The `Int32` type is stored as a big-endian [transformed 32-bit integer](#integer-transformations).

When an array of Int32s is present, the bytes of the integers are subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

### Float32
**Type ID 0x04**

The `Float32` type is stored using the [Roblox float format](#roblox-float-format) and is little-endian. This datatype is also called `float` or `single`.

When an array of Float32s is present, the bytes of the floats are subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

### Float64
**Type ID 0x05**

The `Float64` type is stored using the [IEEE-754 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) and is little-endian. This datatype is also called `double`.

When an array of Float64s is present, they are in sequence with no transformations.

### UDim
**Type ID 0x06**

The `UDim` type is stored as a struct composed of a [`Float32`](#float32) and an [`Int32`](#int32):

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Scale       | [Float32](#float32) | The `Scale` component of the UDim |
| Offset      | [Int32](#int32)      | The `Offset` component of the UDim |

When an array of UDims is present, the bytes of each individual components are stored as arrays, meaning their bytes are subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

As an example, the UDims `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4}` when stored would look like this: `7f 80 00 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 08`.

The first 8 bytes (`7f 80 00 80 00 00 00 00`) represent the Scale values of the UDims. The latter 8 bytes (`00 00 00 00 00 00 04 08`) represent the Offset values. From there, the values are paired off, so that the first value in each array make up the components of the first UDim, and so on.

### UDim2
**Type ID 0x07**

The `UDim2` type is a struct composed of two `UDim`s, one for each axis:

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------|
| X           | [UDim](#udim)       | The `X` component of the UDim2    |
| Y           | [UDim](#udim)       | The `Y` component of the UDim2    |

`UDim2` is stored as four arrays of component values in the order `X.Scale`, `Y.Scale`, `X.Offset`, `Y.Offset`. Each array is separately [byte interleaved](#byte-interleaving).

An encoded `UDim2` with value `{0.75, -30, -1.5, 60}` looks like this: `7e 80 00 00 7f 80 00 01 00 00 00 3b 00 00 00 78`.

### Ray
**Type ID 0x08**

The `Ray` type is a struct composed of six little-endian f32s, making up the components of the `Origin` and then the `Direction` of the Ray:

| Field Name  | Format | Value                                      |
|:------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Origin X    | `f32`  | The `X` component of the Ray's `Origin`    |
| Origin Y    | `f32`  | The `Y` component of the Ray's `Origin`    |
| Origin Z    | `f32`  | The `Z` component of the Ray's `Origin`    |
| Direction X | `f32`  | The `X` component of the Ray's `Direction` |
| Direction Y | `f32`  | The `Y` component of the Ray's `Direction` |
| Direction Z | `f32`  | The `Z` component of the Ray's `Direction` |

The components are stored in order without any additional transformations. When an array of `Rays` is present, they're stored in order but otherwise without transformation.

### Faces
**Type ID 0x09**

The `Faces` type is a single byte used as a bit field. The low 6 bits represent the `Front`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Back`, `Top`, and `Right` faces, in that order. The remaining two bits have no meaning. `Faces` is stored as an array of bytes with no transformations or interleaving.

Three encoded `Faces` with values `Front`, `Back, Top` and `Bottom, Left, Right` looks like this: `01 18 26`.

### Axes
**Type ID 0x0A**

The `Axes` type is a single byte used as a bit field. The low three bits represent the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axes, in that order. The remaining five bits have no meaning. `Axes` is stored as an array of bytes with no transformations or interleaving.

Three encoded `Axes` with values `X`, `X Y`, and `X Z` would look like this: `01 03 05`.

### BrickColor
**Type ID 0x0B**

The `BrickColor` type is a single untransformed big-endian `u32` that represents the `Number` of a BrickColor. When an array of BrickColors is present, the Numbers are [byte interleaved](#byte-interleaving) but otherwise are unchanged.

As an example, three encoded BrickColors with values `Really red (1004)`, `Bright green (37)`, and `Really blue (1010)` look like this: `00 00 00 00 00 00 03 00 03 EC 25 F2`.

### Color3
**Type ID 0x0C**

The `Color3` type is a struct composed of three `Float32`s:

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------|
| R           | [Float32](#float32) | The `R` component of the Color3   |
| G           | [Float32](#float32) | The `G` component of the Color3   |
| B           | [Float32](#float32) | The `B` component of the Color3   |

`Color3` is stored as three arrays of components in the order `R`, `G`, `B`. Each array is separately [byte interleaved](#byte-interleaving).

An encoded `Color3` with RGB value `255, 180, 20` looks like this: `7f 00 00 00 7e 69 69 6a 7b 41 41 42`.

### Vector2
**Type ID 0x0D**

The `Vector2` type is a struct composed of two `Float32`s:

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------|
| X           | [Float32](#float32) | The `X` component of the Vector2  |
| Y           | [Float32](#float32) | The `Y` component of the Vector2  |

`Vector2` is stored as two arrays of components in the order `X`, `Y`. Each array is separately [byte interleaved](#byte-interleaving).

Two encoded `Vector2`s with values `-100.80, 200.55`, `200.55, -100.80` look like this: `85 86 93 91 33 19 35 9a 86 85 91 93 19 33 9a 35`

### Vector3
**Type ID 0x0E**

The `Vector3` type is a struct composed of three `Float32`s:

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------|
| X           | [Float32](#float32) | The `X` component of the Vector3  |
| Y           | [Float32](#float32) | The `Y` component of the Vector3  |
| Z           | [Float32](#float32) | The `Z` component of the Vector3  |

`Vector3` is stored as three arrays of components in the order `X`, `Y`, `Z`. Each array is separately [byte interleaved](#byte-interleaving).

Two encoded `Vector3`s with values `1, 2, 3` and `-1, -2, -3` look like this: `7F 7F 00 00 00 00 00 01 80 80 00 00 00 00 00 01 80 80 80 80 00 00 00 01`.

### CFrame
**Type ID 0x10**

The `CFrame` type is more complicated than other types. To save space, there are 24 special cases where only the CFrame's position is saved. The special case's ID is written as a single byte.

If the byte is `00`, a CFrame looks like this:

| Field Name  | Format              | Value                                                                                                      |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID          | `u8`                | Always `00` in this case.                                                                                  |
| Orientation | Array of 9 `f32`s   | The rotation matrix of the CFrame. It represents the RightVector, UpVector, and LookVector, in that order. |
| Position    | [Vector3](#vector3) | The position of the CFrame.                                                                                |

In this case, the `Orientation` field is stored as nine untransformed [IEEE-754 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) 32-bit floats.

If the `ID` is **not** `00`, it will be a value from the following table. In this case, the `Orientation` field isn't present and is instead equivalent to the angles paired with the `ID` in the table. Rotations in this table are in degrees and are applied in the order `Y -> X -> Z`.

| ID   | Rotation       | ID   | Rotation       |
|:-----|:---------------|:-----|:---------------|
| `02` | (0, 0, 0)      | `14` | (0, 180, 0)    |
| `03` | (90, 0, 0)     | `15` | (-90, -180, 0) |
| `05` | (0, 180, 180)  | `17` | (0, 0, 180)    |
| `06` | (-90, 0, 0)    | `18` | (90, 180, 0)   |
| `07` | (0, 180, 90)   | `19` | (0, 0, -90)    |
| `09` | (0, 90, 90)    | `1b` | (0, -90, -90)  |
| `0a` | (0, 0, 90)     | `1c` | (0, -180, -90) |
| `0c` | (0, -90, 90)   | `1e` | (0, 90, -90)   |
| `0d` | (-90, -90, 0)  | `1f` | (90, 90, 0)    |
| `0e` | (0, -90, 0)    | `20` | (0, 90, 0)     |
| `10` | (90, -90, 0)   | `22` | (-90, 90, 0)   |
| `11` | (0, 90, 180)   | `23` | (0, -90, 180)  |

When an array of CFrames is present, for each value the `ID` is stored followed by the `Rotation` field if it's present. Then, an array of [Vector3s](#vector3) that represent the `Position` field of each CFrame.

As an example, two CFrames with the components `CFrame.new(1, 2, 3)` and `CFrame.new(4, 5, 6)*CFrame.Angles(7, 8, 9)` would be stored as `02 00 4B C0 07 3E 08 9C 75 3D 95 46 7D 3F 1D 25 90 BE 58 6C 74 BF 84 C5 C3 3D 1E 4A 73 3F 6F 19 95 BE 9F A6 E0 BD 7F 81 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 7F 00 22 00 D4 00 B2 80 81 80 80 00 00 00 00`.

The first part (the `ID` and `Rotation` array) is: `02 00 4B C0 07 3E 08 9C 75 3D 95 46 7D 3F 1D 25 90 BE 58 6C 74 BF 84 C5 C3 3D 1E 4A 73 3F 6F 19 95 BE 9F A6 E0 BD`, which is an split into `02` and `00 4B C0 07 3E 08 9C 75 3D 95 46 7D 3F 1D 25 90 BE 58 6C 74 BF 84 C5 C3 3D 1E 4A 73 3F 6F 19 95 BE 9F A6 E0 BD`.

The second part (the `Position` array) is: `7F 81 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 7F 00 22 00 D4 00 B2 80 81 80 80 00 00 00 00`.

### Enum
**Type ID 0x12**

The `Enum` type is an unsigned 32-bit integer. It is stored as big endian and is subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

### Referent
**Type ID 0x13**

The `Referent` type represents a specific Instance in the file and is stored as an [Int32](#int32). After untransforming a referent, a value of `-1` represents the so-called 'null referent'. In a `PROP` chunk, a null referent represents a property with no set value (an example would `ObjectValue.Value` by default).

An array of Referents is stored as an array of Int32s, and as a result they are subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving). When reading an array of Referents, they must be read accumulatively. That is to say that the 'actual' value of the referent is the value of the read value plus the preceding one.

Without accumulation, referents read from a file may look like this. This is **incorrect**:

| Referent 1 | Referent 2 | Referent 3 | Referent 4 | Referent 5 | Referent 6 |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 1619       | 1          | 4          | 2          | 3          | 5          |

The **correct** interpretation of this data, with accumulation, is:

| Referent 1 | Referent 2 | Referent 3 | Referent 4 | Referent 5 | Referent 6 |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 1619       | 1620       | 1624       | 1626       | 1629       | 1634       |

### Vector3int16
**Type ID 0x14**

The `Vector3int16` type is stored as three little-endian `i16`s:

| Field Name | Format | Value                                |
|:-----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| X          | i16    | The `X` component of the Vector3in16 |
| X          | i16    | The `Y` component of the Vector3in16 |
| X          | i16    | The `Z` component of the Vector3in16 |

Multiple `Vector3int16`s are stored in sequence without any transformations or interleaving. Two `Vector3int16`s with values `1, 2, 3` and `-1, -2, -3` are stored like this: `00 01 00 02 00 03 FF FF FE FF FD FF`.

### NumberSequence
**Type ID 0x15**

The `NumberSequence` type is stored as a `u32` indicating how many NumberSequenceKeypoints are in the sequence followed by an array of NumberSequenceKeypoints:

| Field Name     | Format                        | Value                                   |
|:---------------|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Keypoint count | u32                           | The number of keypoints in the sequence |
| Keypoints      | Array(NumberSequenceKeypoint) | The data for the keypoints              |

`NumberSequenceKeypoint` is a struct composed of the following fields:

| Field Name | Format | Value                         |
|:-----------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| Time       | f32    | The time for the keypoint     |
| Value      | f32    | The value of the keypoint     |
| Envelope   | f32    | The envelope for the keypoint |

When multiple NumberSequences are present, they are stored in sequence with no transformation or interleaving. Two NumberSequences with values

```
NumberSequence.new(
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 0),
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 1),
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 1, 0.5)
)
```

```
NumberSequence.new(
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 1),
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 0.5)
)
```

look like this: `03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 3f 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 00`

### ColorSequence
**Type ID 0x16**

The `ColorSequence` type is stored as a `u32` indicating how many ColorSequenceKeypoints are in the `ColorSequence` followed by an array of ColorSequenceKeypoints:

| Field Name     | Format                       | Value                                   |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Keypoint count | u32                          | The number of keypoints in the sequence |
| Keypoints      | Array(ColorSequenceKeypoint) | The data for each keypoint              |

`ColorSequenceKeypoint` is a struct composed of the following fields:

| Field Name        | Format            | Value                                        |
|:------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Time              | f32               | The time value of the ColorSequenceKeypoint  |
| Color             | [Color3](#Color3) | The color value of the ColorSequenceKeypoint |
| Envelope (unused) | f32               | n/a; serialized, but not used                |

Note that `Color` is **not** subject to interleaving like a normal `Color3`. When multiple ColorSequences are present, they are stored in sequence with no transformation or interleaving. Two ColorSequences with values

```
ColorSequence.new(
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.FromRGB(255, 255, 255)),
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.FromRGB(0, 0, 0)),
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.FromRGB(255, 255, 255))
)
```

```
ColorSequence.new(
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.FromRGB(255, 0, 0)),
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.FromRGB(0, 255, 0))
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.FromRGB(0, 0, 255))
)
```

look like this: `03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00`.

### NumberRange
**Type ID 0x17**

The `NumberRange` type is stored as two little-endian floats:

| Field Name | Format | Value                          |
|:-----------|:-------|:-------------------------------|
| Min        | f32    | The minimum value of the range |
| Max        | f32    | The maximum value of the range |

Multiple NumberRanges are stored in sequence with no transformation or interleaving. Two NumberRanges with values `NumberRange.new(0, 0.5)` and `NumberRange.new(0.5, 1)` look like this: `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f`.

### Rect
**Type ID 0x18**

The `Rect` type is a struct composed of two Vector2s:

| Field Name | Format              | Value                         |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:------------------------------|
| Min        | [Vector2](#vector2) | The minimum value of the Rect |
| Max        | [Vector2](#vector2) | The maximum value of the Rect |

`Rect` is stored as four arrays of [Float32](#float32)s in the order `Min.X`, `Min.Y`, `Max.X`, `Max.Y`. Each array is subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

Two encoded Rects with values `Rect.new(-1, -10, 8, 9)` and `Rect.new(0, 1, 5, 6)` look like this: `7f 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 82 7f 40 00 00 00 01 00 82 81 00 40 00 00 00 00 82 81 20 80 00 00 00 00`.

### PhysicalProperties
**Type ID 0x19**

The `PhysicalProperties` type contains a flag which may be followed by a `CustomPhysicalProperties` value. `CustomPhysicalProperties` is a struct composed of five f32s:

| Field Name       | Format | Value                                                        |
|:-----------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Density          | f32    | The density set for the custom physical properties           |
| Friction         | f32    | The friction set for the custom physical properties          |
| Elasticity       | f32    | The elasticity set for the custom physical properties        |
| FrictionWeight   | f32    | The friction weight set for the custom physical properties   |
| ElasticityWeight | f32    | The elasticity weight set for the custom physical properties |

If there is no `CustomPhysicalProperties` value, a `PhysicalProperties` is stored as a single byte of value `0`. Otherwise, it is stored as a byte of value `1` immediately followed by a `CustomPhysicalProperties` stored as little-endian floats (in the same order as the above table). When there are multiple `PhysicalProperties` present, they are stored in sequence with no transformations or interleaving.

A default `PhysicalProperties` (i.e. no custom properties set) followed by a `PhysicalProperties` of value `PhysicalProperties.new(0.7, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1)` looks like this: `00 01 33 33 33 3f 9a 99 99 3e 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f`.

### Color3uint8
**Type ID 0x1A**

The `Color3uint8` type is a struct made up of three bytes, one for each component:

| Field Name  | Format | Value                                |
|:------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| R           | u8     | The `R` component of the Color3uint8 |
| G           | u8     | The `G` component of the Color3uint8 |
| B           | u8     | The `B` component of the Color3uint8 |

`Color3uint8` is stored as three consecutive arrays of components in the order `R`, `G`, `B`. It is not subject to any transformation or byte interleaving.

Two Color3uint8s with the values `0, 255, 255` and `63, 0, 127`, respectively, look like this: `00 3f ff 00 ff 7f`.

### Int64
**Type ID 0x1B**

The `Int64` type is stored as a big-endian [transformed 64-bit integer](#integer-transformations).

When an array of Int64s is present, the bytes of the integers are subject to [byte interleaving](#byte-interleaving).

### SharedString
**Type ID 0x1C**

SharedStrings are stored as an [Interleaved Array](#byte-interleaving) of `u32`s that represent indices in the [`SSTR`](#sstr-chunk) string array.

### OptionalCoordinateFrame
**Type ID 0x1E**

`OptionalCoordinateFrame` is stored the same way as [CFrame](#cframe), but with a couple interesting differences:
* Immediately following OptionalCoordinateFrame's type ID is CFrame's type ID (`10`);
* At the end of the chunk there is an array of Bools (preceded by Bool's type ID, `02`) that indicates which OptionalCoordinateFrames have a value.

An `OptionalCoordinateFrame` with value `CFrame.new(0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)` followed by an `OptionalCoordinateFrame` with no value looks like this: `10 0a 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 01 00`. Note that the valueless `OptionalCoordinateFrame` is written as the identity `CFrame` with its corresponding boolean `00` codifying its valuelessness.

## Data Storage Notes

### Integer Transformations

Some integers may be subject to a transformation to make them more compressable.

To transform an integer: if `x` greater than or equal to zero, transform it with `2 * x`. Otherwise, use `2 * |x| - 1`. In most compilers this is equivalent to `(x << 1) ^ (x >> 31)` for 32-bit integers. For 64-bit integers, the same format is used but with `63` instead of `31`.

To untransform one: if `x` is divisible by 2, untransform it with `x / 2`. Otherwise, use `-(x + 1) / 2`. This is equivalent to `(x >> 1) ^ -(x & 1)`.

Untransforming with bitwise operators requires casting to an unsigned integer in some cases because `x >> 1` will result in a negative number if `x` is negative.

### Byte Interleaving

When stored as arrays, some data types have their bytes interleaved to help with compression. Cases where byte interleaving is present are explicitly noted.

When the bytes of an array are interleaved, they're stored with the first bytes all in sequence, then the second bytes, then the third, and so on. As an example, a sequence of bytes that looks like `A0 A1 B0 B1 C0 C1` would be stored as `A0 B0 C0 A1 B1 C1`.

Viewed another way, it means that the bytes are effectively stored in 'columns' rather than 'rows'. If an array of four 32-bit integers were viewed as a 4x4 matrix, for example, it would normally look like this:

|       | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Row 1 | `A0`     | `A1`     | `A2`     | `A3`     |
| Row 2 | `B0`     | `B1`     | `B2`     | `B3`     |
| Row 3 | `C0`     | `C1`     | `C2`     | `C3`     |
| Row 4 | `D0`     | `D1`     | `D2`     | `D3`     |

When interleaved, the same array would instead look like this:

|       | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Row 1 | `A0`     | `B0`     | `C0`     | `D0`     |
| Row 2 | `A1`     | `B1`     | `C1`     | `D1`     |
| Row 3 | `A2`     | `B2`     | `C2`     | `D2`     |
| Row 4 | `A3`     | `B3`     | `C3`     | `D3`     |

### Roblox Float Format

Some data types do not follow the [IEEE-754 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) format for 32-bit floating point numbers. Instead, they use a proprietary format where the sign bit is after the mantissa.

| Format   | Bit Layout                            |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------|
| Standard | `seeeeeee emmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm` |
| Roblox   | `eeeeeeee mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmms` |

Where `s` is the sign bit, `e` is an exponent bit, and `m` is a mantissa bit.

As a practical example, below is a comparison of how `-0.15625` is stored:

| Format   | Binary View                           | Byte View     |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------|
| Standard | `10111110 00100000 00000000 00000000` | `be 20 00 00` |
| Roblox   | `01111100 01000000 00000000 00000001` | `7c 40 00 01` |
